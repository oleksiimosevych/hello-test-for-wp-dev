It is a test work to apply for a job as wp php dev
Ok, if you want to test this app you have to
1. download LocalWP and install it
2. create your first wp-app with a name wordpress
3. rewrite your folder with your WP (copy into that folder my files from GitHub hello-test-for-wp-dev branch mosevych_main)
4. start app
5. go to a page or to a post and click that button with the same name Button
6. you will see Hello World alert and it the JS Console you will see Hello world text too.
7. if you want to see how is working custom post type and custom taxxonomy - you have to login as admin. login is admin password is admin2021
8. if plugins were not activated - activate it.
